## Project 1: Battery Management System (BMS)

### Core Logic
- Modeled a **multi-cell battery pack** with dedicated **State-of-Charge (SoC) estimation** algorithms.

### Closed-Loop Management
- Integrated **thermal management** and **cell-balancing control loops** to ensure safe and efficient operation.

### Fault Protection
- Implemented monitoring and protection logic for:
  - Over-voltage
  - Under-voltage
  - Over-temperature conditions

## Project 2: Active Suspension System

### System Dynamics
- Modeled a **2-DOF quarter-car system** to represent the interaction between road disturbances, suspension, and vehicle body.

### Control Objective
- Improved **passenger comfort** and **road handling** by controlling actuator forces between the wheel assembly and the chassis.

### Control Implementation
- Designed a **closed-loop feedback architecture** to minimize:
  - Vertical body acceleration
  - Suspension deflection

## Project 3: Aircraft Pitch Control

### System Modeling
- Developed a **linearized longitudinal flight dynamics model** to represent aircraft pitch behavior.


### Closed-Loop Analysis
- Evaluated system performance and stability using:
  - Step response simulations
  - Root Locus analysis
  - Bode plot analysis
